## Purpose of tutorial

  The purpose of this tutorial is to teach you how to use headers within your writing in code to help make your differnt points separate but still coherent.


## Single PoundHeader

Contrary to popular belief with headers the size is actually the opposite of what you belive like with
# "Hi"
typically you would guess that making that Hi that large you would need many # but in realitly it only takes one. With headers the bigger you want your word to be the less # you want to use. Normally you would want to save the largest one for the title of you work at the top of your project. To use it you simply start a new line and start it with a # followed by what you would like to say, "# words of wisdom".

## Double PoundHeader

Now moving on to the second largest of the header sizes we have the Double PoundHeader,
## "Hi"
typically you would want to use either this one or the Tripple Poundheader when doing subsections in your writing. It helps divide up your work, and keep things flowing consistently so that you don't have to worry about where one things ends and another one starts. To use it you simply start a new line and start it with ## followed by what you would like to say, "## words of wisdom".

## Triple PoundHeader

Flowing right into the second smallest of the main 4 header sizes the Triple PoundHeader,
### "Hi"
typically you could also use this in lu of the Double PoundHeader. It serves the same purpose in dividing up the subsections in your writing. To use it you simply start a new line and start it with ### followed by what you would like to say, "### words of wisdom".

## Quadruple PoundHeader

To end us off, we will conclude with the Quadruple PoundHeader,
#### "Hi"
typically you could use this to make a list that you would like slightly larger or a second subsection within the main on, due to the fact that it is only slightly larger then the typical size when typing. To use it you simply start a new line and start it with #### followed by what you would like to say,"#### words of wisdom".

## Target Audience

The target audience for this project is for someone who is just starting out on git hub and is having trouble figuing out sizing for their words and projects. I honestly feel like this is really useful since when I was starting out I was having to scroll through google looking for this but I think it would be useful to provide, since I'm rather forgetful and would have it on my own github list.

## Purpose of tutorial

  The purpose of this tutorial is to teach you how to use headers within your writing in code to help make your differnt points separate but still coherent.


# Single PoundHeader

Contrary to popular belief with headers the size is actually the opposite of what you belive like with
# Hi
,typically you would guess that making that Hi that large you would need many "#" but in realitly it only takes one. With headers the bigger you want your word to be the less "#" you want to use.
